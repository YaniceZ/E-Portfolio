I hold a BSc in Geography from South China Normal University and am currently pursuing an MGEM degree at UBC, focusing on GIS, remote sensing, and sustainable land-use planning. My experience includes internships in urban planning and research on land-use dynamics, forest resources, and park use patterns, earning recognition for innovation. Passionate about sustainability, I aim to apply geomatics to address environmental and social challenges.
